# Stenen
This is our implementation of the famous game Asteroids. 

Use cabal to build the project:
1. Install cabal if you haven't already
2. Run a powershell/cmd window from this folder
3. Make sure cabal is up to date by running command: cabal update
4. Enter command: cabal run (builds and runs the game)
5. Enjoy! 

Instructions on how to play will be given within the game.

Note: Controlled Folder Access might stop the game from accessing highscore.txt, leading to a crash. 
If that happens, allow the game access, re-run, and it should be fixed.
